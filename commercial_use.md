# Commercial Use & Community Support Policy

We actively encourage developers to build and sell products using this base project! To ensure the ecosystem remains healthy, we have established clear guidelines for independent commercial use versus official ecosystem integration.

## 1. Independent Commercial Works (No Royalties)
You are free to monetize independent commercial projects built with this code. 
* **No Mandatory Profit Share:** If you are simply using the base project as a foundation for your own completely independent game or application, no mandatory revenue share or royalty is required.
* **Improvement Reciprocity:** As per the `LICENSE.txt`, any engine or system improvements and extensions you make must grant the project rights to reuse and integrate them.

## 2. Official Integration & The Community Support Program (CSP)
**Developers who wish to use official branding, promotion, or ecosystem integration must participate in the Community Support Program (CSP).**

If you want your project to carry our official "Approved" branding, be promoted on our official channels, or hook directly into our official ecosystem/servers, you must opt into the CSP.

### How the Community Support Program Works:
The intention of the CSP is not to tax indie developers, but to create a symbiotic ecosystem where commercially successful projects help fund the open-source contributors who built their foundation.

* **The Funding Mechanism:** Participants in the CSP agree to contribute a defined percentage of their project's revenue (negotiated prior to official integration) to the Community Support Fund.
* **The Distribution Model:** 100% of the funds collected through the CSP are routed directly into the project's Contributor Reward Pool. 
* **Proportionate Allocation:** The total fund pool is distributed proportionately to community contributors based on the functional impact, scope, and usefulness of their integrated work.
* **Project Manager Discretion:** To ensure fairness and protect against gamification, the final valuation of contributions and the distribution of the CSP pool are determined entirely at the discretion of the Project Manager. 

If you are interested in joining the Community Support Program to receive official backing and branding for your commercial release, please contact the Project Manager directly to establish a CSP agreement.
