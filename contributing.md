# Contributor License Agreement & Reward Policy

By submitting any contribution to this project (via pull request, issue tracker, Discord, or other official channels), you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Definition of Contribution
Contributions include, but are not limited to: Code, technical systems, artwork, animation, audio, narrative design, documentation, bug reports, and community tools.

## 2. Rights Granted (CLA)
You grant the project owner (OpenStar Project) a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to:
* Use, modify, and distribute your contribution.
* Integrate it into the base project or related commercial products.
* Sublicense it as part of the project.
* **Note:** You retain the copyright to your original work and the right to use your contribution elsewhere.

## 3. Original Work Requirement
You confirm that your contribution is your original creation, or you have the explicit legal right to submit it under these terms.

## 4. Community Reward Pool
We believe in rewarding the talent that builds this ecosystem. The Contributor Reward Pool is funded by **[e.g., 90%] of our Patreon revenue** PLUS **100% of proceeds generated from the Community Support Program (CSP)**.

* **Distribution Model:** The total fund pool is distributed proportionately based on integrated contributions in the current base version, estimated functional impact, and asset scope.
* **Maintainer Discretion:** Final reward allocation decisions and contribution valuations are made at the sole discretion of the Project Manager. Unused funds roll over to future distributions.
* **Payment Nature:** Rewards are discretionary community "thank you" gifts. They do not constitute an employer-employee relationship, royalties, profit-sharing, equity, or a guarantee of future payment.

## 5. Dispute Resolution
Any disputes arising from participation in the project or the contributor reward program shall be resolved through binding arbitration conducted in the State of Texas, United States, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Each party shall bear its own legal costs.
