# [Starcell]

Welcome to ** Starcell **! This is an open, simplified, game design playground intended to be a basic functional game usable by all levels of aspiring game makers to test ideas and gain practocal game design experience. 
Whether you are here to build your dream project, learn how things work, or contribute to a growing ecosystem, we are thrilled to have you!

## 🚀 Our Unique "Open Core" Model
We want this project to be as accessible as possible while ensuring the core system continually improves for everyone. We operate on an **Open Core with Reciprocity** model. 

What does this mean for you?
* **Build & Sell:** You are totally free to use this project to build and sell your own commercial games or applications. No mandatory royalties or profit-sharing.
* **Keep Your IP:** Your original assets, story, and unique branding belong 100% to you.
* **Share the Upgrades:** If you modify or improve the *base project code*, we require that you grant us the right to roll those improvements back into the main repository for the whole community to enjoy. 
* **Official Branding:** Want to use our trademark, get official ecosystem integration, or be promoted on our channels? Check out our [Community Support Program (CSP)](COMMERCIAL_USE.md).

## 💰 Get Paid to Contribute
We believe that open-source contributors should be rewarded. That is why we run a **Community Contributor Reward Pool** funded by our Patreon and proceeds from commercial CSP partners. If you contribute code, art, or fixes that get merged into the base project, you may be eligible for a discretionary cash reward! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
